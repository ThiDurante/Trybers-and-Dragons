# Trybers and Dragons

A simple study of OOP using Typescript and a D&D Theme.

## Installation and use

This one is not really meant to create something, its more of a study project, but if you want to see it do:

```bash
# First clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/ThiDurante/trybesmith.git
# Now let's get into the folder
cd trybesmith
# instal dependencies
npm i
```

You can use the src/index.ts file to create monsters, players and log battles.
Will require a little bit of Typescript knowledge
